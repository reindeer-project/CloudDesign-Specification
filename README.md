# The Cloud Design Specification

The Cloud Design Specification is proposed by [Reindeer Project](https://reindeer.tech) and licensed under [the Apache License, Version 2.0]((https://github.com/reindeer-project/CloudDesign-Specification/blob/master/LICENSE)).
The Cloud Design Specification (the "CDS") defines a standard, provider-agnostic procurement data of cloud computing which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the computing without access to working resources, various documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote computing service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. 
CDS can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the computing architecture, archiving tools to deploy it to the blockchain as the safe and reusable knowledge base, auditing tools, and many other use cases.
